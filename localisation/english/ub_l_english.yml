 singularity_sphere_ruined: "Singularity Engine: Ruins"
 singularity_sphere_ruined_DESC: "Once the Singularity Engine is destroyed, only ruins remain, with its once reality-defying power lost. It becomes an unstable spatial region, with residual energy still affecting the surrounding cosmic structure, occasionally producing unpredictable spatial anomalies. These ruins serve as a reminder of the limitless potential and pinnacle of technology it once held, but also of the catastrophic consequences that can arise from misusing power beyond reality."
 singularity_sphere_0: "Singularity Engine: Quantum Core Activation"
 singularity_sphere_0_DESC: "The construction of the core system of the Singularity Engine begins, activating its basic quantum functions."
 singularity_sphere_1: "Singularity Engine: Dimensional Warp Generation"
 singularity_sphere_1_DESC: "The Singularity Engine starts to affect spatial dimensions, generating local temporal distortions."
 singularity_sphere_2: "Singularity Engine: Multiverse Interference"
 singularity_sphere_2_DESC: "The power of the Singularity Engine influences surrounding realities, creating multiversal interference."
 singularity_sphere_3: "Singularity Engine: Transcendence of Reality"
 singularity_sphere_3_DESC: "The Singularity Engine completely surpasses the boundaries of reality, manipulating and even creating new layers of existence."
 singularity_sphere_4: "Singularity Engine: Singularity Ascension"
 singularity_sphere_4_DESC: "The Singularity Engine has transcended all physical laws, becoming the ultimate entity in the universe, capable of manipulating the fundamental mechanisms of time, space, and energy, achieving absolute mastery over reality."
 singularity_sphere_modifier: "Singularity Engine"
 singularity_sphere_modifier_DESC: "The Singularity Engine is a reality-transcending technology capable of manipulating the fundamental mechanisms of time, space, and energy, achieving absolute mastery over reality."
 ub_singularity_sphere.0.name: "Quantum Core Activation"
 ub_singularity_sphere.0.desc: "The quantum core of the Singularity Engine has been successfully activated. For the first time, we have directed the flow of fundamental quantum particles and, through precise control of their entanglement states, have opened a window into higher-dimensional space.\n\nThis is only the first step—we must continue to break through higher-dimensional barriers to fully harness this power."
 ub_singularity_sphere.0.a: "Continue optimizing particle control mechanisms."
 ub_singularity_sphere.1.name: "Dimensional Warp Generation"
 ub_singularity_sphere.1.desc: "Through the Singularity Engine, we have successfully triggered local spacetime distortions. The physical laws within the engine's internal region have begun to destabilize, the speed of light has been redefined, and the flow of time has become malleable.\n\nAlthough the current effects are limited, we are now entering a phase of altering the fundamental structure of the universe, and must continue pushing the project forward."
 ub_singularity_sphere.1.a: "Analyze the stability of the spacetime curvature."
 ub_singularity_sphere.2.name: "Multiverse Interference"
 ub_singularity_sphere.2.desc: "The power of the Singularity Engine has already surpassed the dimensions of our universe. We have successfully interfered with multiple parallel realities, altering the material structures and event sequences within them.\n\nThese interferences help us understand the fundamental laws behind the universe, but they also bring new uncertainties and risks."
 ub_singularity_sphere.2.a: "Increase observation of multiversal realities."
 ub_singularity_sphere.3.name: "Transcendence of Reality"
 ub_singularity_sphere.3.desc: "The latest upgrades to the Singularity Engine have freed it entirely from the physical constraints of our universe. We have accessed transcendental energies—forms of existence beyond spacetime, allowing us to manipulate and reshape reality at its core.\n\nHowever, this new power of immense potential also comes with unpredictable consequences."
 ub_singularity_sphere.3.a: "Utilize transcendental power with caution."
 ub_singularity_sphere.4.name: "Singularity Ascension"
 ub_singularity_sphere.4.desc: "The Singularity Engine has reached its final form—it is no longer a tool, but a being that controls reality, time, and space. We have fully transcended the limits of physics and entered a new realm of mastery over the structure of the universe.\n\nThis supreme power enables us to shape any reality we desire, but we must wield it wisely."
 ub_singularity_sphere.4.a: "Master the fate of the universe."
